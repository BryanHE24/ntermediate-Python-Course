GIL: Global Interpreter Lock
- A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in python

- Needed in Cpython Because memory management is not thread-safe

- Avoid:
 - Use multiprocessing
 - Use a different, free-threaded python implementation (Jpython, IronPython)
 - Use python as a wrapper for third-party libraries (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
