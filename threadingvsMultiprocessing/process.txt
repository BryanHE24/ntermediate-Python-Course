Process: An instance of a program (e.g a python interpreter)

Advantages:
+ takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Separate memory space -> memory is not shared between processes
+ Great for CPU-Bound processing
+ New process is stated independently from other processes
+ Processes are interruptable/killiable
+ One GIL for each process -> avoids GIL Limitation

Disadvantages:
- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread.
- more memory
- IPC (Inter-process communication is mroe complicated)
