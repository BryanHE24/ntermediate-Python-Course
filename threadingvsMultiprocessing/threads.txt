Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as "lightweight process)
A process can spawn multiple threads.

Advantages:
+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ lightweight
+ starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ great for I/O-bound tasks

Disadvantages:
- Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU-Bound tasks- Not interruptable/killiable
- Careful with race conditions (Race conditions Occurs where when two or mroe threads want to modify the same variable at the same time)
